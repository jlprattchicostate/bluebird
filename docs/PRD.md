# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title
**Bluebird**

## Description
Bluebird is a mobile-first web app that gathers weater and road condition information around ski resorts to help skiers choose the best resort to visit.

## Scope
Based on the Analyst’s Level 1 Specification, Bluebird v1 will include features in four epics:

- **Discover Berries**
  - Map, list, filters, freshness indicators, favorites
- **Shop Vendors**
  - Vendor profiles, inventory, specials, hours
- **Engage Community**
  - Ratings, reviews, photos, reputation, reporting
- **Utilize Smart Features**
  - Alerts, seasonality insights, offline cache

### Out of Scope
- Payments or delivery integration  
- Advanced ML/AI models for recommendations  
- Cross-region data aggregation

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Client)
- **React + Vite + TypeScript** (PWA, mobile-first design)
- **TailwindCSS** + **shadcn/ui** components (Radix primitives: accessible + customizable)
- **React Router** for navigation
- Deployed via **AWS Amplify**

### Backend (API Layer)
- **Express.js REST API (Node.js)**
  - Serves as the single gateway for all data operations
  - Handles authentication, validation, and routing
  - Organizes CRUD endpoints by feature area (e.g., `/vendors`, `/berries`, `/reviews`)
  - Middleware for logging, error handling, and request validation
- **Rule:** All CRUD operations go through the API — the frontend must **not** call Supabase DB directly.

### Database & Authentication
- **Supabase (Postgres-based)** for:
  - Data persistence
  - Authentication (OTP email code; role-based access)
  - Realtime subscriptions (optional for v1)
- The API connects to Supabase via the Supabase client or `pg` driver.
- **Authentication approach:**
  - Frontend may call Supabase Auth (OTP email code) directly to obtain a session/JWT.
  - API also exposes OTP wrappers (`/auth/otp/start`, `/auth/otp/verify`) for future clients and policy controls.
  - All protected API routes require `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Frontend:** AWS Amplify (continuous deployment from GitHub)
- **API Layer:** Serverless functions
  - **AWS Lambda (preferred)** — Express wrapped with `serverless-http`
- **Database:** Managed directly in the Supabase cloud instance

### Development Tools
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration
- **Windsurf IDE** for coding environment
- **Trello** for task management
- **Slack** for team communication

## Key Considerations
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear distinction between frontend (UI), API (business logic), and DB (persistence).
- **Role-Based Access:** API enforces role permissions (e.g., shopper vs. vendor).
- **Environment Variables:** API keys stored in `.env` (never committed).
- **Scalability:** Architecture is overkill for a class project, but reflects industry practices.
